    <h2>Near-death studies</h2>
    <p>
        <br>  In 1986 Perry's interest in the effects and meaning of near-death experiences led him to a professional 
        <br>   involvement with Raymond Moody, M.D., Ph.D., considered to be the founder of near-death studies.[2] 
        <br>  The two have written six books together (Paranormal, Glimpses of Eternity, The Light Beyond, Coming Back, 
        <br>  Reunions and Paranormal.) He co-authored Evidence of the Afterlife. All told he has written or co-written 
        <br>  10 books on the subject of near-death experiences, four of which have become New York Times bestsellers.[3]
        <br> "Although these books have been co-authored with several different researchers, I think of them as one work," 
        <br> he said in a 2008 interview. "They all probe the same question (What happens when we die?) from several different
        <br> angles. It's one of mankind's most important questions and I believe these books have gone a long way in answering it."

    <h2>Adventure and biography
    </h2>
    <p>
        <br>In 1981, Paul went to China with author Ken Kesey (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)) to cover 
        <br>the First International Beijing Marathon for Running Magazine, for which he was editor. The two spent
        <br>a month traveling on a bus through China. Upon their return, Kesey and Perry began discussing the possibility 
        <br>of compiling a book of photographs from Kesey's famous bus trip across the United States, known as The Kool 
        <br>Aid Acid Trip. Kesey agreed to give Perry access to his photo archives. Perry joined forces with Ken Babbs,
        <br>Kesey's sidekick, to produce On the Bus: The Complete Guide to the Legendary Bus Trip of Ken Kesey and the
        <br>erry Pranksters and the Birth of the Counterculture. The book is a photo documentary of the Acid Trip that
        <br>tells the story of the birth of the psychedelic era through interviews with Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary,
        <br>members of the Grateful Dead, and others.[4]
        <br>Publisher's Weekly said of On the Bus, "This book lacks only a bound-in tab of LSD-25 to make it the real thing."
        <br>In 2012, the book was purchased by James Franco and is currently in development as a feature film.
        <br>Perry followed with Fear and Loathing: The Strange and Terrible Saga of Hunter S. Thompson, a biography of the 
        <br>late Gonzo journalist. Much of the biography was based on several months spent together working on The Curse of Lono,
        <br>a book that sprang from an article on the Honolulu Marathon published in Running, a magazine edited by Perry.[5]
        <br>The book was unauthorized and angered Thompson, who declared Perry was "stealing my material." Later, in Entertainment 
        <br>Weekly, Thompson gave the book the highest grade of all biographies written about him at that time.
        <br>In 2001, only weeks after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center in New York, Perry went to Egypt to follow the 
        <br>trail of Jesus in Egypt. This is a trail that follows ancient sites and artifacts and is believed by Christians and 
        <br>Muslims alike to be the route followed by the Holy Family as they fled from the soldiers of King Herod.
        <br>Perry spent two months on the trail, which runs from the Egyptian border with Israel, through the Delta and south to 
        <br>Assiut, which is about 150 miles below Cairo. He stopped at more than 30 sites believed to have been visited by the Holy 
        <br>Family, including monasteries built around a stone believed to be the bed of baby Jesus and an area where bright lights 
        <br>that flash from the sky attract tens of thousands of people from all over Africa. He is the first Westerner to complete 
        <br>the entire Holy Family Trail.
        <br>Perry wrote Jesus in Egypt upon his return, a book praised for its stories of the people of Egypt by Booklist, and 
        <br>lauded by Publisher's Weekly.[6]
    </p>
    <h2>Documentary films
    </h2>
    <p>
        <br>When his book Jesus in Egypt was published, a television producer approached Perry and offered to fund a
        <br>documentary film of the Egypt journey. Perry returned to Egypt with a camera crew in 2004 and followed 
        <br>the trail a second time to make a documentary film. The film, Jesus, the Lost Years was premiered at the 
        <br>Cairo Opera House in 2005 to members of the Mubarak family and more than 1500 others, including Egyptian 
        <br>cabinet members, ambassadors and Saudi princes.[7]
<br>
        <br>Mrs. Mubarak expressed great admiration for the film in the Egyptian press, and admitted that it showed 
        <br>"an Egypt I have never seen." She agreed to let the film be sold in Egypt under the condition that the 
        <br>name of Jesus not appear in the title to avoid inflaming Muslim radicals. As a result the film was released 
        <br>in the Middle East under the title The Holy Family in Egypt.
<br>
        <br>The making of Jesus, the Lost Years led Perry to start a documentary film production company, Sakkara 
        <br>Productions, which is named after the first stone pyramid. He also started a second film production company, 
        <br>Paul Perry Productions.
<br>
        <br>Perry's next documentary, Visions and Miracles: Out of the Land of Egypt contains never-before seen footage 
        <br>of visions and miracles that have taken place in modern day Egypt, including Marian apparitions near Cairo 
        <br>that tens of thousands of people have witnessed. Other documentary film include:
<br>
        <br>AFTERLIFE, tackles the fascinating subject of near-death experiences and interviews scientists who have 
        <br>researched proof of a life after death. It also features a number of people who have died and returned to 
        <br>tell stories of what they experienced on the brink of death.[8]
<br>
        <br>"Dali's Greatest Secret," about a secret painting of artist Salvador Dali that changed his life yet was 
        <br>hidden underneath a nun's bed for nearly 30 years. The film won honorable mention at film festivals in Berlin,
        <br> Madrid, and Nevada and has been shown at theaters, museums and art galleries internationally.
<br>
        <br>"The Secret Mummies of Lisbon," tackles the bizarre excavation of 78 mummies concealed and forgotten in a 
        <br>Lisbon church. Done at the request of the Catholic church, the expedition shown a light on life in early Portugal.
<br>
        <br>"The Light Beyond," is a talkumentary with Raymond Moody, MD, Phd, whose research into near-death experiences 
        <br>both defined and named the phenomenon.
<br>
        <br>"Secrets and Lies of Christopher Columbus," to be released in 2019, is a well-sourced and controversial 
        <br>documentary containing solid evidence that explorer Christopher Columbus was not Italian but the bastard 
        <br>child of Portuguese royalty whose mother was Jewish and father a Duke. The movie reveals new evidence that 
        <br>he was a secret agent for King John II of Portugal who helped convince the pope to rearrange the map of the
        <br>world, giving Portugal claim to Brazil, a country they had secretly discovered. The movie includes revealing 
        <br>interviews with the Duke of Braganza, Christopher Columbus XX, Vasco da Gama XIX, and historians and Dr. 
        <br>Jose Lorenta, a noted DNA scientist.
        <br>Perry's recent work is taking him deeper into the world of near death experiences, a subject about which 
        <br>he has written 14 books. The book he is currently working on, to be published in 2021, delves deeper into 
        <br>shared death experiences than Glimpses of Eternity, which he wrote with Dr. Moody in 2010. Glimpses launched 
        <br>a new field of near death research. Perry is also working on another documentary film (yet to be named) about 
        <br>near death experiences.
